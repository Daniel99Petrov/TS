# ZOD
# A way to use zod in browser is to use a bundler (vite for example). How to setup:

# 1) navigate to the directory you want to create the project folder in
# 2) run `npm create vite@latest . -- --template vanilla-ts` -> this would setup a project with a bundler
# 3) navigate to the created project folder and run `npm install`
# 4) you could install zod with `npm install zod`
# 5) `npm run dev`is the command to start the app
